"""Several files in this resource use HGNC gene symbols to identify individual
genes. However, the symbols assigned to HGNC IDs can change over time, and
therefore previously curated symbols can become invalid. This script
generates a mapping of current (i.e. at the time of running the script)
mappings of HGNC IDs to symbols so that the assumptions about the identity
of the genes in the various tables can be traced."""
